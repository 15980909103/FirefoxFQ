Instead I will be splitting it into smaller extensions which I will upload. I am keeping a list of which ones are WebExtension enabled here.\nFor those buttons that opened different pages, you can get them from my Link Buttons page or make your own with my Link Button Maker.\n\nAny future releases of Toolbar Buttons itself would only support Thunderbird, Palemoon or SeaMonkey.\n\nToolbar Buttons is the single biggest button pack for Firefox or Thunderbird there is. There are now over 100 Firefox, 50 for Thunderbird. You will find buttons that enable hidden functionality or is too many clicks away, but some of the best buttons are those unique to the extension. For example from some of out most popular buttons, there are menu items for, Options, Bookmark Manager, Bookmark Page, and Add-ons, but for Snap Back, Restart and about:config there is no existing user interface.\n\nTo find out more information about each of the buttons, please see our Button List which has descriptions of all the buttons.\n\nOnce installed to get started using the buttons open the Customize Coolbar window by either right clicking on the toolbar and selecting Customize from the pop up menu or going View then Toolbars then Customize and from the window that opens up you can drag the buttons to your toolbar.\n\nIf you don't want so many buttons in one extension you can choose individually using the Toolbar Button maker. This tool also had extra features such as being able to create toolbar. It also servers as a testing ground for new buttons, so it has a number that are not in this extension.\n\nTranslations are made by volentears, if you would like to help please vist BabelZilla.\n\nAll Applications\nAdd-ons, Console, Customize Toolbar, DOMi, Edit Menu, Exit, Extensions, File Menu, Import, Install, Minimize, Options, Page Setup, Profile, Redo, Reload Proxy, Restart, Select All, Status Bar, Themes, Toggle menu bar, Toggle Proxy, Toolbars, Tools Menu, Undo, Update, View Menu\n\nFirefox and Thunderbird\nabout:config, Change Dictionary, Change Text Direction, Delete, Enlarge, Extensions, Find, Find Again, Find Previous, Help, Print Preview, Reduce, Reset, Save, Source, Themes, Work Offline\n\nFirefox\nAbout, about:cache, about:cache Disk, about:cache Memory, about:plugins, Animation, Bookmark All, Bookmark Manager, Bookmark Menu, Bookmark Page, Bookmark Toolbar, Bottom, Change Home, Clear Data, Clear Url, Clipboard Link, Close All, Close Other Tabs, Close Tab, Current Frame, eBay, Extensions, Favorite Page, Flash, Full Screen, Google Mail, Google, Hide Images, Hide Url, Hotmail, iframes, Link Setting, Minimum Font Size, Movies, New Message, Next Tab, Open, Page Colours, Page Fonts, Page Info, PayPal, Previous Tab, Quick Bookmark, Read Mail, Read News, Reload Skip Cache, Reload Tabs, Remove Label, Remove Labels, Rename Tab, Restart Tabbed, Save Frame, Send Link, Show Frame, Snap Back, Stop All, Tab List, Themes, Tiny Url, Toggle Cookies, Toggle embedded content, Toggle Images, Toggle Java, Toggle JavaScript, Toggle Styles, Toggle Toolbar, Toolbar Bookmark Menu, Top, Translate, Undo Close Tab, Up Directory, Web Search, Wikipedia, Yahoo Mail\n\nThunderbird\nAbout, Account Settings, Account Setup, Add Email, All Threads, Compact, Copy, Copy Email, Create Filter, Cut, Delete Attachments, Delete Junk, Detach Attachments, Edit Draft, Empty Trash, Filters, Forward as Attachment, Forward Inline, Get Inbox, HTML Mode, Ignored Threads, Mail Toolbar, Message Pane, Next Message, Paste, Plain Text Paste, Previous Message, Purge, Read, Reply to Sender Only, Return Receipt, Save Attachments, Search Addresses, Search Messages, Send & Receive, Send Without Save, Skip Trash, Threads With Unread, Toggle Read, Toggle Starred, Unread Threads, Watched Threads With Unread\n\nSunbird\nAbout, Delete Events, Delete Tasks, Toggle Tasks, Tasks In View, Toggle Toolbar\n\nIf you find bugs or have a question just post on our Forums or check the FAQ.\n\nHave an idea for a new button that you would like?

Saving an image to disk requires opening the context menu, finding the corresponding save entry, selecting a directory and finally a name.\n\nThis is where DragIt helps out. Save text and images to preconfigured folders, search the web, open links in tabs or with extern applications, download and much more with just a mouse gesture.\n\nHow does it work?\nJust grab an object and drag it up, down, left or right and run the assigned action. Text selections, links, images, addons and extern objects have there own respective set of configurable actions.\n\nDragIt comes with its own configurable context menu which may also be activated by a gesture.\n\nIt gives feedback via a configurable tooltip, a configurable mouse trail or the statusbar.

It also works with most video sites like DailyMotion, Facebook, Periscope, Vimeo, Twitch, Liveleak, Vine, UStream, Fox, Bloomberg, RAI, France 2-3, Break, Metacafe and thousands others.\n\nVideo DownloadHelper supports several types of streamings, making the add-on unique amongst Video downloaders: HTTP, MP2T, F4F, … Whenever a site uses a non-supported streaming technology, Video DownloadHelper is also able to capture directly from the screen and generate a video file out of it.\n\nAs a bonus, Video DownloadHelper can also record Twitter Periscope. Just specify search terms and the add-on will capture over night related live streams.\n\nAs another bonus, you can also use Video DownloadHelper to capture a full browsing session, optionally highlighting the mouse position and generate a video file out of it. This is ideal to create Web a site demos as a video.\n\nBesides downloading, Video DownloadHelper is also able to make video conversion (changing audio and video formats) and aggregation (joining separate audio and video to a single file) very easy. This is a commercial feature that helps paying for the free stuff (we need to eat too). You are not compelled to use conversion for downloading videos from web sites, and you can avoid picking variants marked as ADP to avoid the need for aggregation.\n\nWhen you first install the extension, your browser is redirected to a welcome page with links to a user manual at http://www.downloadhelper.net/howto.php.\n\nThis does not change your homepage setting and the welcome page won't appear anymore.\n\nYou may want to watch this video about using Video DownloadHelper 5: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhqUx-b5-bE\n\nSupport can be obtained from http://www.downloadhelper.net/support.php.\n\nIf you want to test developments version, check this forum https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/video-downloadhelper-5.\n\nPlease stay tuned by following us on Twitter (@downloadhelper), Google + or Facebook.\n\nIf you enjoy the free service from Video DownloadHelper, we would appreciate a donation (or BTC: 1Eqe8DN6uJwVcHoqyfCPpMy6Q5FzjqcWLZ)

Bluefang","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/zh-CN/firefox/user/SparkyBluefang/?src=api"},"description":"Status bar widgets and progress indicators for Firefox 4+","fullDescription":"In Firefox 4, the status bar was replaced with the \"Add-on Bar\", an empty, but customizable, toolbar. While some of the status bar items did find new homes, you may not have like where they ended up. There were also some nice innovations during the development of Firefox 4, such as putting progress/links/status in the location bar, which unfortunately didn't make it to the final release.\n\nIn Firefox 29, Mozilla decided it would rework the UI again, and ended up removing the Add-on Bar as well.\n\nStatus-4-Evar aims to bring back the Status Bar / Add-on Bar with the familiar classic status bar items, give you more control over the built-in Firefox features, and provide new alternatives.\n\nThe extension provides \"Status Text\", \"Progress Meter\", \"Download Status\", and \"Legacy Status Bar\" (Firefox 29+) items. These toolbar items can be moved wherever you want by customizing the toolbars. Behavior of the toolbar items, and other additional settings, can be controlled in the Status-4-Evar preferences.\n\nThis extension can also act as a replacement for the Fission extension. There are preferences to show links, status, and progress in the location bar instead of the toolbar items.\n\nCheck out the code! S4E is now on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/SparkyBluefang/S4E\n\nWant to provide a translation? Status-4-Evar can be found on BabelZilla:\nhttp://www.babelzilla.org/forum/index.php?showtopic=6532\n\nKnown Issues\n\n    Firefox 4 - 28: by default, there is a flexible space on the Add-on Bar. When you install S4E, this flexible space gets replaced with the Status Text toolbar item. When you disable/uninstall S4E, this toolbar item obviously goes away. To \"fix\" the toolbar, all you have to do is customize the toolbar and put a flexible space between the close button and everything else.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------\n\nPlease do not email me for support/help/bug reports. I will not respond and will probably just delete it. The preferred way to contact me is to post in the official support topic on MozillaZine or create an issue on GitHub.","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/55/55260.png?src=api&modified=1313340435","width":"700","height":"509","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/55/55260.png?src=api&modified=1313340435","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"145","caption":"S4E provides a handful of toolbar items replicating the functionality of the old status bar.
